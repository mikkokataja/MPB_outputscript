# MPB_outputscript
This is just simply a ready Python script for MIT Photonic Bands (MPB) simulations package that includes a custom run function to output the 4 electromagnetic fields into h5 files. It's a bit more versatile than the built-in output band functions in MPB and you can modify it further e.g. to output fields from different simulation runs with different filenames etc.
