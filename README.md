# MPB_outputscript
This is just simply a ready Python script for MIT Photonic Bands (MPB) simulations package that includes a custom run function to output the 4 electromagnetic fields into h5 files. It's a bit more versatile than the built-in output band functions in MPB and you can modify it further e.g. to output fields from different simulation runs with different filenames etc.

The script simulates the 2D photonic crystal detailed in P. Moitra et al: Realization of an all-dielectric zero-index optical metamaterial
